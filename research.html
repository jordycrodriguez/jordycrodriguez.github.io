            <h3>AI Supply Chain</h3>
            <p>
            Over the past week, I’ve been trying to understand the supply chain that enables the commercial deployment of AI systems after reading <a href="https://aipolicy.substack.com/p/supply-chains-2" target="_blank">this article from a former college professor</a>. The growing interest in AI from companies and consumers has been catalyzed by GenAI models from a select number of companies: OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta. But the rapid growth of AI adoption has mainly been centered around the suppliers of foundational models (e.g. GPT-4) and startups building applications powered by foundational models (e.g. chatbots, virtual assistants). This overlooks the various stakeholders within the supply chain that help train, fine-tune, integrate, deploy, and manage AI systems for the best end-user experience for businesses and consumers. The current state is reminiscent of the early days in IT services outsourcing.

            Given the existing growth of LLMs and adjacent foundational models is a result of companies and universities building on decades of AI R&D, there is an opportunity in for startups that enable and manage the efficient deployment of AI systems for companies and consumers globally. Below is a quick categorization of different areas in the supply chain from upstream to downstream stages of AI development and deployment (this is my first attempt at organizing different literature, so it is subject to change). The interactions between stakeholders across the supply chain cannot be easily mapped because they are not as linear as traditional goods supply chains. This ecosystem graph from Stanford’s Center for Research on Foundational Models aims to show the connections between various providers in the AI supply chain.
