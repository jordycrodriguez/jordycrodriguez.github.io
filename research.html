            <h2>Example Investment Memo</h2>
            <h3>Summary</h3>
                <p>We recommend an $8.6M investment in the XXX-led Series A financing round for Farmu, a leading B2B marketplace for independent pharmacies in Colombia, at a $43M pre-money valuation. This investment gives XXX 20% fully diluted ownership and a board seat.</p>
                <p>Our belief in Farmu’s success is defended by Francisco’s vision to solve supply chain inefficiencies for independent pharmacies, his ability to build an experienced team, Farmu’s efforts to optimize unit economics, market trends, and the size of the market. Farmu currently serves more than 3,000 pharmacies across 6 major cities in Colombia. Their catalog offers over 2,700 unique products to their customers from more than 100 manufacturers. Farmu’s value proposition for pharmacies are low prices, high product selection, on-site delivery, and inventory management. The value propositions for manufacturers are insights into pharmacy purchasing behavior and marketing opportunities. By creating mutually beneficial relationships with pharmacies and manufacturers, Farmu positions itself as a valuable partner to both sides of the marketplace, giving them the opportunity to diversify products and services within the vertical.</p>
                <p>Farmu’s leadership possesses years of business development, marketplace, and supply chain management experience that will help them execute their vision to modernize the supply chain for independent pharmacies in Latin America. In addition to the team’s academic and professional aptitude, Francisco’s grit in the early days of Farmu conducting on-the-ground research, personally operating fulfillment, and using local messengers for delivery demonstrates his commitment to the problem and resilience to problem-solve for customers. Additionally, Fabián Gómez Gutiérrez, sits on Farmu’s board, offering valuable guidance for scaling and optimizing supply chain solutions in Colombia, Mexico, and Brazil.</p>
            <h4>About Farmu</h4>
                <p>Farmu was founded by Francisco Jassir in 2021 in Colombia. To access Farmu’s catalog, pharmacy owners need to provide a business license (Cámara de Comercio), business tax ID number (RUT), and the pharmacy’s address. Customers can access the platform and place orders anytime via a smartphone, tablet, or desktop. In addition to their marketplace, Farmu provides credit opportunities to their active customers; to become eligible for credit, customers must be on Farmu for 2 months and have placed at least 5 orders with a minimum value of ~$25 USD.</p>
                <p>They offer low prices to the pharmacies by securing wholesale contracts directly from manufacturers. They offer high product selection by constantly adding new manufacturers’ products to their catalog. They offer on-site delivery by operating their own distribution centers and providing last-mile delivery to their customers. Lastly, they provide inventory management solutions by learning from their customers’ purchasing behavior to predict which products they may need to stock or restock, ensuring pharmacies’ end customers have the best selection of products available. Unlike traditional distributors, Farmu’s technology platform enables them to offer manufactures insights on their customers and market trends.</p>
            <p><strong>Team</strong></p>
                <p>Francisco J. Jassir founded Farmu in 2021.

Before founding Farmu, he was a supply chain specialist at Frubana, a B2B marketplace for restaurants. He was a business analyst at McKinsey Colombia before attending business school at Columbia Business School. Daniel Echeverri Froidefond is Chief Operations Officer.

After receiving his bachelor’s in business administration from ICESI, he held roles at Banco de Occidente, Citi, and Linio Colombia (an e-commerce platform). Additionally, he was the founder of lamerienda, an online ingredients and recipe delivery platform, and Peppy, a cold press juice business. Martín González Sierra is Head of Growth and was previously Head of Revenue. Before Farmu, Martín held various corporate banking roles at Bancolombia. He earned his bachelor’s in business administration at CESA. Ignacio Correa de Losada is Vice President of Product and was previously Head of Growth.

            <h3>Market Opportunity</h3>
                <p>The existing supply chain model includes 4 major stakeholders: manufacturers, distributors, retail pharmacies, and end customers. Incumbent distributors are available through multiple channels: online marketplaces, WhatsApp, and physical warehouses. The model has generally remained unchanged in Latin America. Existing inefficiencies in the supply chain result in expensive transactions and losses for independent pharmacies. As independent pharmacies experience intensifying competition, improving their operations to save time and money can make the difference between thriving and shutting down.</p>
                <p>There are multiple market conditions that present tailwinds for Farmu:</p>

                      <th>Tailwinds</th>

                    <tr>
                      <td>Increase in household spend on health-related products</td>
                      <td>After COVID-19, health has become top-of-mind for people to avoid getting sick or minimize the symptoms of illnesses. Health and fitness also remain a strong trend in LatAm, as shown by the rise of Mexican, Colombian, and Brazilian fitness influencers and regional growth of SmartFit, a Brazilian gym franchise. This generates demand for health-related products sold at independent pharmacies.</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                      <td>Intensifying pharmacy competition</td>
                      <td>The rise of delivery platforms, such as Rappi, UberEats, and Justo, have facilitated the success of franchises with deep pockets who can pay for promotions and campaigns on delivery platforms. Large competitors also own tools and data that efficiently manage inventory. This creates an opportunity for Farmu to help independent, local pharmacies compete with larger competitors by leveraging their competitive advantages to thrive.</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                      <td>Decentralized distribution channels</td>
                      <td>There are various distribution channels available to pharmacies: manufacturers, wholesale distributors, and even other pharmacies. Pharmacies typically must have multiple vendors due to ineffective inventory planning, limited product availability from distributors, unreliable delivery times, and varying product quality among vendors. This facilitates the adoption of Farmu's marketplace where they can get inexpensive, high-quality products with reliable deliveries; they also benefit from Farmu's data analytics to better plan their purchases and manage inventory.</td>
