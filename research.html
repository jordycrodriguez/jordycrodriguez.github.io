            <h3>AI Supply Chain</h3>
            <p>
            Over the past week, I’ve been trying to understand the supply chain that enables the commercial deployment of AI systems after reading <a href="https://aipolicy.substack.com/p/supply-chains-2" target="_blank">this article from a former college professor</a>. The growing interest in AI from companies and consumers has been catalyzed by GenAI models from a select number of companies: OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta. But the rapid growth of AI adoption has mainly been centered around the suppliers of foundational models (e.g. GPT-4) and startups building applications powered by foundational models (e.g. chatbots, virtual assistants). This overlooks the various stakeholders within the supply chain that help train, fine-tune, integrate, deploy, and manage AI systems for the best end-user experience for businesses and consumers. The current state is reminiscent of the early days in IT services outsourcing.

            Given the existing growth of LLMs and adjacent foundational models is a result of companies and universities building on decades of AI R&D, there is an opportunity in for startups that enable and manage the efficient deployment of AI systems for companies and consumers globally. Below is a quick categorization of different areas in the supply chain from upstream to downstream stages of AI development and deployment (this is my first attempt at organizing different literature, so it is subject to change). The interactions between stakeholders across the supply chain cannot be easily mapped because they are not as linear as traditional goods supply chains. This ecosystem graph from Stanford’s Center for Research on Foundational Models aims to show the connections between various providers in the AI supply chain.

                There is a unique space for investors to support AI startups that orchestrate different levels in the supply chain to unlock value in developed and underdeveloped regions by tailoring products and services to regional business practices and consumer preferences. Facilitating the deployment and management of AI systems for organizations with limited technical resources, such as SMBs, has the potential to improve their financial and operational outcomes to help them reach new levels of success.

            <p>
                The objective of this summary is to help categorize AI startups, as there is value yet to be unlocked across different levels of the supply chain. A follow-up to this is a market map similar to one created by the Madry Lab at MIT for startups and a better understanding of the physical infrastructure that enables AI deployment—infrastructure necessary for energy-efficient, performance-maximizing deployments. For example, CPUs / GPUs, semiconductors, data centers, cloud services, fiber / 5G networks, and advanced energy technologies among others. But the current context signals there is high value in future physical infrastructure because the demand for systems currently exceeds the current supply today’s infrastructure can support.
